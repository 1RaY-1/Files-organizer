# About the program
It can be very useful.

If needed directory does not exist, this program will create it itself.

This program should work on Linux, Mac and Windows, but maybe you'll need to change some things.

# Get started
First of all you need to install module **watchdog**, install it by executing:
```
pip install watchdog
```
or
```
pip3 install watchdog
```
Before you start using it, you need to enter your username and change directories if needed and you can change more things.
This program can work like a service, because when you run it you don't have to do nothing.

# How it works
If you let everything by default and you run it, this program will track the **Downloads** directory (Linux Downloads directory) and if you move there a file with for example **.mp3** extension, program will create there (in Downloads directoy) a folder named **Music**, if not created and will move this file to the **Music** directory.

# Note
It isn't perfect, there are still lots of things that I think should be improved.

Maybe I will improve it soon.
